Big-Juicy-Sass
==============

Just my own personal boilerplate, you don't have to use it, but it's filled with stuff that I find really useful.

I find it quite useful for templating on a local environment with includes and such.

Some of the resources here are no longer in the repo, you will need to "CD" into the top-level directory, then use "bower install" in cmd line. Some resources are not available in bower, so I will keep them here (datejs, placeholders.js, modernizr).
