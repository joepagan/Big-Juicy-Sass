## CraftCMS Plugins

I'm not going to include any plugins within this repo because they are all updated very frequently, and, their use is very much situational dependent on the project & the client.

### FormBuilder2
[https://github.com/roundhouse/FormBuilder-2-Craft-CMS](https://github.com/roundhouse/FormBuilder-2-Craft-CMS)<br> [https://github.com/roundhouse/FormBuilder-2-Craft-CMS/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/roundhouse/FormBuilder-2-Craft-CMS/archive/master.zip)

What I think to be the best form solution for Craft at the current time. It's free, and, just as good as the only other usable costly alternative "Sprout Forms".

### SEOmatic
[https://github.com/nystudio107/seomatic](https://github.com/nystudio107/seomatic)<br>
[https://github.com/nystudio107/seomatic/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/nystudio107/seomatic/archive/master.zip)

I only started using this plugin in the past week, but, now I would deem it to be a "core" plugin, it adds extensive relevant schema, and, appears to be extreme customisable. A great addition to your site, which, should bring many benefits to your site in SERPs.

### Minify
[https://github.com/nystudio107/minify](https://github.com/nystudio107/minify)<br>
[https://github.com/nystudio107/minify/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/nystudio107/minify/archive/master.zip)

A simple plugin that allows you to minify code, a more vigorous version of the twig tags "spaceless"

### FeedMe

[https://github.com/engram-design/FeedMe/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/engram-design/FeedMe/archive/master.zip)

This is probably the only plugin I have found that is worth using without major issues. You can either import entries from JSON, RSS, XML, and you can even import data into a matrix field!

### File Get Contents
[https://github.com/lexbi/File-Get-Contents-Plugin---CraftCMS](https://github.com/lexbi/File-Get-Contents-Plugin---CraftCMS)<br>
[https://github.com/lexbi/File-Get-Contents-Plugin---CraftCMS/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/lexbi/File-Get-Contents-Plugin---CraftCMS/archive/master.zip)

A very simple plugin which makes a handful of php functions available in CraftCMS templates. This is mainly utilised to inject CSS into the head element to get that all important high Google Page Speed score.

### Image Resizer

[https://github.com/engram-design/ImageResizer](https://github.com/engram-design/ImageResizer)<br>
[https://github.com/engram-design/ImageResizer/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/engram-design/ImageResizer/archive/master.zip)

Quite often it is the case that the users that have been provided access to a CMS unfortunately are not very technical. This has often resulted in dramatically large images being uploaded to a CMS, as an example this could be an image with dimensions of 8000px x 6000px, this plugin resizes images like that to parameters that you can set in the backend. I normally set this to be a max width & height of 2000px, which saves server space, and, potentially a broken webpage.

### Hacksaw

[https://github.com/ryanshrum/hacksaw/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/ryanshrum/hacksaw/archive/master.zip)

A simple text truncation plugin for Craft CMS that takes your content and hacks it down to more manageable sizes.

### Client Widgets

[https://github.com/lexbi/craftcms-dashboard-client-widgets/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/lexbi/craftcms-dashboard-client-widgets/archive/master.zip)

My own creation, this adds the ability to add a few widgets to the dashboard which attempt to give a decent explanation between singles, channels & structures to a user that may not be familiar with CraftCMS.

### Asset Links
[https://github.com/Hambrook/AssetLinks](https://github.com/Hambrook/AssetLinks)<br>
[https://github.com/Hambrook/AssetLinks/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/Hambrook/AssetLinks/archive/master.zip)

This adds a download icon to the backend where assets are used. CraftCMS doesn't make it easy to actually download the asset when you have selected one on an entry.

### Control Panel CSS

[https://github.com/lindseydiloreto/craft-cpcss](https://github.com/lindseydiloreto/craft-cpcss)<br>
[https://github.com/lindseydiloreto/craft-cpcss/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/lindseydiloreto/craft-cpcss/archive/master.zip)

This plugin lets you add styles to the dashboard/control panel area in CraftCMS.

### Reasons

[https://github.com/mmikkel/Reasons-Craft/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/mmikkel/Reasons-Craft/archive/master.zip)

This plugin lets you show & hide fields dependent on the result entered for another. You could setup some behaviour where if a checkbox was checked, that could either hide existing, or, show additional fields on that entry.
