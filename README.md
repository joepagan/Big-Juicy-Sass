Big-Juicy-Sass
==============

Just my own personal boilerplate, you don't have to use it, but it's filled with plugins and such. Uses php, so this good for templating on a mamp/xampp environment

## SASS/SCSS
Yup, it's using Sass with compass & [the SASS animate.css port by ericam](https://github.com/ericam/compass-animation)

## JS/jQuery
Lots of plugin here, I'll listen them eventually...
